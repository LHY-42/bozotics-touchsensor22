# HCI BOZOTICS CLUB: Team Nuts
## Roboticians with too much caffeine at hand
### Who we are
* Fan Wendi 
* Loh Hao Yuan
* Lee Yu Zhe

We are a group of *sane* Secondary One students from the Hwa Chong Infocomm and Robotics Society (Robotics) that take part in robotics competitions representing our school.

This repository is for the NRC 2022 (and possibly WRO 2022)

### What we use

We use the Pybrick library to program Lego robots (because haojun refuses to let us use more dangerous stuff)
